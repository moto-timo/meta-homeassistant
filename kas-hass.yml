    # Yocto Project SState Mirror
    #
    # The Yocto Project has prebuilt artefacts available for its releases, you can enable
    # use of these by uncommenting some of the following lines. This will mean the build uses
    # the network to check for artefacts at the start of builds, which does slow it down
    # initially but it will then speed up the builds by not having to build things if they are
    # present in the cache. It assumes you can download something faster than you can build it
    # which will depend on your network.
    # Note: For this to work you also need hash-equivalence passthrough to the matching server
    # There is a choice between our sstate server directly and a faster content delivery network
    # (CDN) kindly provided by JSDelivr, uncomment one of the SSTATE_MIRRORS lines, not both.
    # Using the CDN rather than the yoctoproject.org address is suggested/preferred.
